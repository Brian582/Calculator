# Calculator

This project is a calculator that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

In HTML, I developed the calculator, the buttons, and received input from those buttons to display in the calculator.

In CSS, I styled the calculator, the buttons, and the display bar.

In JavaScript, I wrote code to evaluate the expression and clear the display bar.
